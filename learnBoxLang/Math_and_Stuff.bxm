        language but let me say a quick word on that. There is a saying that to be good in computer programming, you
        need to be good at math. However, I don't think (actually I pretty much know for a fact) that it isn't
        strictly true. What I think is meant by that is that it helps to think logically and mathmaticians tend to think
        very formally and logically. That isn't meant to say that other people don't, it just happened that
        alot of the original computer people were hard core math types and the stereotype stuck. But that's all it
        is...a stereotype. </p>
